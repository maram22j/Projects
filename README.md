# RNA seq analysis and segregation between up and down regulated genes: 

The dataset contains an experiment between a diseased cell line and diseased cell lines treated with compound X. The difference in expression change between the two health status is computed as Fold change to log 2 (Log2FC) and the significance of each is computed in p-value.

## Objectif:
In this mini project, my main focus is to exploring the data using base R functions and then interpret of the functions of up and down regulated genes.


## Tasks conducted:

1. Generating a volcano plot. 
2. Determining the upregulated genes (Genes with Log2FC > 1 and pvalue < 0.01)
3. Determining the upregulated genes (Genes with Log2FC < -1 and pvalue < 0.01)
4. What are the functions of the top 5 upregulated genes and top 5 downregulated genes. (Use genecards)
