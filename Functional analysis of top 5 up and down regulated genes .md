# Interpretation:

From the upregulated genes we have selected 5 genes: 
<ul><li> <B>EMILIN2:</B> elastin microfibril interfacer 2 is a protein coding gene predicted to enable extracellular matrix constituent conferring elasticity. Predicted to be involved in cell adhesion. Located in extracellular region. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022] </li>
<li> <B>POU3F4:</B> POU class 3 homeobox 4 is a protein coding gene that encodes a member of the POU-III class of neural transcription factors. This family member plays a role in inner ear development. The protein is thought to be involved in the mediation of epigenetic signals which induce striatal neuron-precursor differentiation. Mutations in this gene are associated with X chromosome-linked nonsyndromic mixed deafness. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2012] </li>
<li><B>VEPH1:</B>ventricular zone expressed PH domain containing 1 is a protein coding gene predicted to enable phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate binding activity. Involved in negative regulation of SMAD protein signal transduction and negative regulation of transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway. Predicted to be active in plasma membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022] </li>
<li><B>DTHD1:</B> death domain containing 1 encodes a protein which contains a death domain. Death domain-containing proteins function in signaling pathways and formation of signaling complexes, as well as the apoptosis pathway. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
